Local Tables
    A create table statement names a table globally
    A with clause of a select statement names a table that is local to the statement

    With Syntax
        with
            best(dog #can have multiple names here referring to different names in the table) as (
                select 'eisenhower' union
                select ' barack'
                )
        select <stuff>

Recursive Local Tables
    Local Tables can be Declared Recursively
        An ancestor is your parent or an ancestor of your parent

    Global Names for Resursive Tables
        To create a table with a global name, you need to select the contents of the local table

Limits on Recursive Select Statements
    Recursive table definitions are only possible within a with clause
    No mutual recursion: two or more tables cannot be defined in terms of each other
    No tree recursion: the table being defined can only appear once in a from clause
