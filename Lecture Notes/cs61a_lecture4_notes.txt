The Fibonacci Sequence Iteration Example

def fib(n):
	pred, curr = 0, 1
	k = 1
	while k < n:
		pred, curr = curr, pred + curr
		k = k +1
	return curr

Characteristics of Functions
	A function’s domain is the set of all inputs it might possibly take as arguments.

	A function’s range is the set of output values it might possibly return.

	A pure function’s behavior is the relationship it creates between input and output.

Guide to Designing a Function
	Give each function exactly one job.
	Don’t repeat yourself (DRY). Implement a process just once, but execute it many times.
	Define functions generally
		Want functions to solve all problems that are of the same type.

Assert Statement: Declares that some assignment is true
	assert <condition>, <string>
	if the condition is false, then message appears.

Higher Order Functions
	The common structure among functions may be a computational process, rather than a number. 
	Takes another function as an argument.

	Functions as Return Values
		Locally Defined Functions: Functions defined within another functions bodies are bound to names in a local frame.
			i.e. a def statement within a def statement
