Order of Recursive Calls
	Note: print(n) binds n to a value, in environment diagrams
		  if there is no specific return statement, the default return is none.

	Anything that comes after a recursive call is not computed until the recursion stops (i.e. it doesn’t stop until a Return value appears.)
	
	Once a return statement is reached nothing is executed after it. 

In recursive functions put the base case first. <-- you’ll have an easier time.

Tree Recursion
	Tree-shaped processes arise whenever executing the body of a recursive function makes more than one recursive call

Repetition in Tree-Recursive Computation
	This process is highly repetitive. There is techique that reduces the amount of repitions. 

Counting Partitions
	The number of partitions of a positive integer n, using parts of up size m, is the number of ways in which n can be expressed as the sum of positive integer parts up to m in increasing order.
