Midterm 2 Material Ends with this Lecture

Sets
    A built in container data type
    Set literals are enclosed in braces {}
    Intrinsic Properties:
        Duplicate elements are removed on construction
        Sets are unordered, just like dictionary entries
    Example:
        >>> s= {3, 2, 1, 4, ,4}
        >>> s
        {1, 2, 3, 4}
    No indices
    Has 'in' operator
    Has len
    Operations of Union and Intersection (called with dot notation)
        Usual set theoretic operations

Implementing Sets
    What we should be able to do with a set
        Membership testing
        Union
        Intersection
        Adjoin
            One set and an extra element

Sets as Unordered Sequences
    Proposal 1: A set is represented by a linked list that contains no duplicate items

\theta(n^2) occurs when we have an inner process and an outer process

    Proposal 2: A set is represented by a linked list with unique elements that is ordered
                ordered from least to greatest

    Proposal 3: A set is represented as a Tree with two branches. Each entry is:
        Larger than all entries in its left branches 
        Binary Trees

Binary Trees
    A binary tree is a tree that has a left branch and a right branch
    Idea: Fill the place of a missing left branch with an empty tree
    Idea 2: An instance of Binary Tree always has exactly two branches
