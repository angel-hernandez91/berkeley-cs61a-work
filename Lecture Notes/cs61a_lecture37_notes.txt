Ambiguity


Context-Free Grammar Rules
    A grammar rule describes how a tag can be expanded a sequence of tags or words
    S --> NP VP
    NP --> N
    N --> Some noun
    VP --> V NP
    V --> Some verb

Exhaustive Parsing
    Expand all tags recursively, but constrain words to match input

Scoring a Tree Using Relative Frequencies
    Not all syntactic structures are equally common
