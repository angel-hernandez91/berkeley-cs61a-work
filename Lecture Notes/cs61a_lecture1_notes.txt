Types of Expressions:
	An expression describes a computation and evaluates to a value
		i.e. 18+69, 6/23, sin(pi), etc...
	All expressions can use function call notation
		i.e. f(x)
	Nesting of functions, inside first, then out. (Recall function composition from Abstract Algebra)

Anatomy of a Call Expression
	add		(	2	,	3	)
	operator	operands
	Evaluation procedure for call expressions:
		1. Evaluate the operator and then the operand subexpressions
		2. Apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpressions to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpression.
			note: subexpression is an expression within an expression.
			Expression Trees show how these nested expressions are evaluated.
