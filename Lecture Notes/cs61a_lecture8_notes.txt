Abstraction
    Functional Abstractions
        Intrinsic name: the original name of a function
        Need to know how man arguments a function takes
        What the function does, but no necessarily how

Alternative GCD

def gcd(m, n):

if m == n:
    return m
elif m < n:
    return gcd(n, m)
else:
    gcd(m - n, n)

Decorators
    What do they do?
        They're a higher order function. That can be added to the top of another function using the @<function> decorator
        It is similar to binding the functions name to the result of calling the decorator on the function.

Currying
    A higher order procedure that turns a function with multiple arguments into a single argument higher order function.
    This can be done to any such function.

Review:
    What would python print?
    Interactive output: >>> in terminal
    Evaluates to: what it returns
