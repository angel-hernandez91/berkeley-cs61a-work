Information Hiding
    An attribute name that starts with one underscore is not meant to be referenced externally
    This naming convention is not enforced, but is typically respected.
    A programmer who designs and maintains a public module may change internal-use names
    Starting a name with two underscores enforces restricted access, unless you are in in class itself

    Names in Local Scope
        A name bound in a local frame is not accessible to other environments, except those that extend the
        frame
    Singleton Objects
        A singleton class is a class that only ever has one instance
        NoneType, the class of None, is a singleton class. None is its only instance

        For user-defined singletons, some programmers re-bind the class name to the instance
        Bind name of class to instance of the class, so others use only one instance of it

Streams (another implicit sequence)
    A stream is a linked list, but the rest of the list is computed on demand
    Once created, Streams and Links can be used interchangeably using first and rest methods
        Ex:
            Stream(anything, zero-argument function that returns a Stream or Stream.empty)
            Note the similarity with Linked lists

    This a form a lazy computation. Nothing is computed until it is explicitly called.
    Errors are not raised until a value is requested and then computed

    Integer Stream
        An integer stream is a stream of consecutive integers

        An integer stream starting at first is constructed from first and a function compute_rest
        that returns the integer stream starting at first+1

Stream Processing
    Lazy computation and recursion
    Recursive calls can be delayed by putting in a lambda function that is only called when the rest is
    called by user
    Streams can be defined in terms of themselves.
        Need an inital element, and lazily computed using a lambda function to delay the computation

Stream Implementation
    A stream is a recursive list with an explicit first element and rest-of-the-list that is computed
    lazily

Higher Order Functions on Streams
    Mapping a Function over Stream
        Mapping a function over a stream applies a function only to the first element right away. The
        rest is computed lazily.

        The body is not executed until compute_rest is called

    Filtering a Stream
        When filtering a stream, processing continues until an element is kept in the output
        Ex: The Seive of Eratostones
