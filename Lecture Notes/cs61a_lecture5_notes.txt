Announcements:
	Guerrilla Section1 on higher-order functions is on Saturday 1/31 in 271 Soda. 4pm - 6pm

Environments Enable Higher-Order Functions
	Functions are first-class: Functions are values in our programming language

	Higher-Order function: A function that takes a function as an argument value or A function that returns a function as a return value
	
	Environment diagrams allow us to describe how these work.

A functions frame is the current frame in which the function is defined. 
	*This occurs in nested functions that call functions

The parent of a function is the frame in which it was defined. Every local frame has a parent frame (often global). The parent of a frame is the parent of the function called. 

When functions return a global parameter ‘not found’ error. Why?
	An environment is a sequence of frames.
	The environment created by calling a top-level function...

	If you want the functions to communicate with each other you need to nest.
