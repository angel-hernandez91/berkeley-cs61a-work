Lecture: Information Hiding

An attribute name that starts with one underscore is not meant to be referenced externally.
    _ implies that "don't reference directly, they may change"
    Not special properties, not part of symantics

The naming convention is not enforced, but is typically respected
A programmer who designs and maintains a public module may change internal-use names
Starting a name with two underscores enforces restricted access from outside the class

Names in Local Scope
    A name bound in a local frame is not accessible to other environments, except those that
    extend the frame
    These also hid names from other users
    Those in yields, generator functions

Singleton Objects
    A singleton class is a class that only ever has one instance
    i.e.
    NoneType, the class of None, is a singleton class; None is its only instance
    For user-defined singletons, some programmers re-bind the class name to the instance
        Naming a class, then assigning the name of the class to an instance of the class
        The original binding is now lost (kind of), hides the class from the user

Stream Implementation
    A stream is a linked list with an explicit first element and a-rest-of-the-list that is
    computed lazily.

Lecture: Declarative Languages
    Database Management Systems
        Database management systems (DBMS) are important, heavily used, and interesting!
        A table is a collection of records, which are rows that have a value for each column
        The Structured Query Language (SQL) is perhaps the most widely used programming language
        SQL is a declarative programming language

    Declarative Programming
        In declarative languages:
            A program is a description of the desired result
            The interpreter figures out how to generate the result
    Imperative languages:
        In imperative languages such as python and scheme:
            A program is a description of computational processes
            The interpreter carries out execution/evaluation rules
; Semicolon ends and SQL statements (note that statements can span several lines)

SQL Overview
    The SQL language is an ANSI and ISO standard, but DBMS implement custom variants
        A select statement creates a new table, either from scratch or by projecting a table
        A create table statement gives a glocal name to a table
        Lots of other statements exist:
            Analyze, delete, explain, insert, replace, update
        Most of the important things are in select

Getting started with SQL
    Install sqlite (version 3.8.3 or later)

Selecting Value Literals
    A select statement always includes a comma-separated list of column descriptions
    A column description is an expression, optionally followed by as and column name
        select [expression] as [name], [expression] as [name];
    Selecting literals creates a one-row table
    The union of two select statements is a table containing the rows of both of their results

Naming Tables
    SQL is often used as an interactive language
    The result of a select statment is displayed to the user, but not stored
    A create table statement gives the result a name
        create table [name] as [select statement];

Projecting Tables
    A select statment can specify an input table using a from clause:
        select [expression] as [name], [expression] as [name], ...;
        select [columns] from [table] where [condition] order by [order];
    Column descriptions determine how each input row is projected to a result row
