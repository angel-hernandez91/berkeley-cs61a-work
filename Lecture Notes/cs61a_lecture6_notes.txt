Recursive Functions
	Def: A function is called recursive if the body of that function calls itself, either directly or indirectly.

	Implication: Executing the body of a recursive function may require apply that function

Example: Digit Sums

The Anatomy of a Recursive Function
	The def statement header is similar to other functions
	Conditional statements check for base cases
	Base cases are evaluated without recursive calls
	Recursive cases are evaluated with recursive calls

For environment diagram each time the recursive function is called we create a new frame, and we keep descending into new frames until we get a definite return value that does not rely on having to compute other parts of the recursion.

Solve the recursive function by making a simpler function on each recursive call. 

Iteration vs Recursion
	Iteration is a special case of recursion.
