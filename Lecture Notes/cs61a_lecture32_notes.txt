Joining Two Tables
    Two tables A and B are joined by a comma to yield all combos of a row from A and a row
    from B

    Example:
        Assume two tables 'dogs' and 'parents'
        select parent from parents, dogs
                where child = name and fur = 'curly'
        Note that here we are assuming the column names are unambiguous

Aliases and Ambiguity
    Two tables may share a column name; dot expressions and aliases disambiguate column 
    values
        Syntax:
            select [columns] from [table] where [condition] order by [order];
    [table] is a comma-separated list of table names with optional aliases
    Select all pairs of siblings
        Syntax:
            select a.child as first, b.child as second 
                from parents as a, parents as b
                where a.parent = b. parent and a.child < b.child
Joining Multiple Tables
    Multiple tables can be joined to yield all combinations of rows from each

Numerical Expressions
    Expressions can contain function calls and arithmetic operators

String Expressions
    String values can be combined to form longer strings
    Basic string manipulation is built into SQL, but differs from Python
    Syntax Example:
        select 'hello,' || ' words';

Query Planning
    The manner in which tables are filtered, sorted, and joined affects execution time.
