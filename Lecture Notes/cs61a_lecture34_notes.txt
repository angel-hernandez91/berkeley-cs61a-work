Aggregation (with SQL)
    So far, all SQl expressions have referred to the values in a single row at a time.
    An aggregate function in the [columns] clause computes a value from a group of rows
    These are suppose to appear in the column description, not in where clauses


Mixing Aggregate Functions and Single Values
    An aggregate function also selects a row in the table, which may be meaningful
    If there are multiple sensible answers, it returns an arbitrary answer that satisfy the
    aggregate function

Grouping Rows
    Rows in a table can be grouped, and aggregation is performed on each group
    The number of groups is the number of unique values an expression

where filters individual rows
having filters whole groups and allows aggregate functions in the expression
