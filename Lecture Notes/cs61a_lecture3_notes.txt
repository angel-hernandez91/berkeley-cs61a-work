Frames are created whenever a user defined function is called. Note that there also frames called when we call built-in functions, but we don’t write those. We just say they exist in the global frame. Furthermore, each frame starts a new environment. 

Parent=Global (Tells you where to go from the current frame, i.e. the frame preceded it, also note that everything ends at the global frame)

Every expression is evaluated in the context of an environment. 

A name evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found. 

Names have Different Meanings in Different Environments
	-A call expression and the body of the function being called are evaluated in different environments. 
	-Rule of Thumb:
		*Non-indented lines evaluated in global frame
		*Indented lines are evaluated in local frame

from operator import truediv (/), floordiv(//), mod (%)

doctest runs the examples given in the docstring of a function
	for docstring do:
	“”” Do this and this, blah blah blah. 
	>>> execute blah
	result
	>>> execute blah 2
	result 2
	“””
Doctests tests to make sure the function passes the example provided. 


Statements:
	A statement is executed by the interpreter to perform an action.
	A suite is a sequence of statements, To execute them they are executed in order unless otherwise directed

Conditional Statement:
	Execution Rule:
		Each clause is considered in order
			1. Evaluate the header’s expression
			2. If it is a true value, execute the suite & skip the remaining clauses. 

	Execution Rule for while Statements:
		1. Evaluate the header’s expression
		2. If it is a true value, execute the (whole suite), then return to step 1.
